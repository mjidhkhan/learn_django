# The integration of Tailwind CSS framework with Django a.k.a. Django + Tailwind = ‚ù§

Author: Tim Kamanin
## Quick start
Install the python package django-tailwind from pip
```shell
$ pip install django-tailwind
```
Alternatively, you can download or clone this repo and run pip install -e ..

Add tailwind to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

Create a tailwind-compatible Django-app, I like to call it theme:
```shell
$ python manage.py tailwind init theme
```
Add your newly created theme app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

In settings.py, register tailwind app by adding the following string:
```python
TAILWIND_APP_NAME = 'theme'
```
Run a command to install all necessary dependencies for tailwind css:

```shell
python manage.py tailwind install
```
Now, go and start tailwind in dev mode:
```shell
python manage.py tailwind start
```
Django Tailwind comes with a simple base.html template that can be found under yourtailwindappname/templates/base.html. You can always extend it or delete it if you have own layout.

If you're not using base.html template provided with Django Tailwind, add styles.min.css to your own base.html template file:

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="{% static 'css/styles.min.css' %}"
  type="text/css"
/>
You should now be able to use Tailwind CSS classes in your html.

To build a production version of CSS run:
```shell
python manage.py tailwind build.
```
NPM executable path configuration
Sometimes (especially on Windows), Python executable can't find NPM installed in the system. In this case, you need to set NPM executable path in settings.py file manually:
```
NPM_BIN_PATH = '/usr/local/bin/npm'
```
Please note that NPM path of your system may be different. Try to run which npm in your command line to get the path.
